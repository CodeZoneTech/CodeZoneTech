    <title>Grading Students</title>

<body class="text-white bg-dark">
    <div class="container pt-5">
        <h1>Guptha University</h1>
        <p class="pt-3">University has the following grading policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Every undergraduate receives a grade in the inclusive range from 1 to 100.
            </li>
            <li>Any grade less than 40 is a falling grade.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Guptha is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the difference between the grade and next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the value of grade if less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the value of grade if less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Eg :</p>

        <ul>
            <li>grade = 73 round to 75 (75-73 is less than 3)</li>
            <li>grade = 13 do not round</li>
            <li>grade = 51 do not round (55-51 is more than 3)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="pt-3">
            Guptha like to have average grade of the undergraduates in the University.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="">
            Given the initial value of geade for each of Guptha's undergraduates, write code to find the average of the the undergraduates including the rounding process.
